    * `id`: primary key

    * `name`

    * `email`

    * `password`

## üí° Hints

* What tools can you use to test the existing API routes if you don't yet have a front end?

* Where would you place the client-side JavaScript for capturing form data?

* How can middleware help protect routes from non logged-in users?

* How can Handlebars.js helpers (both built-in and custom) be used to render the desired results?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Add an `/edit/:id` route for logged in users to update their projects' details. Then deploy the app to Heroku!
